## 🚀 Project Objectives

The goal of SentinelLite is to demonstrate how multiple security data sources can be analyzed together to detect potentially malicious activity across a network environment.

The tool integrates:

- **Nmap network host discovery**
- **PCAP traffic analysis (4 detection tests)**
- **Web server access log parsing**
- **Static blocklist validation**
- **IP activity correlation**
- **Risk severity classification**
- **Automated CSV & HTML report generation**
- **Optional alert email notifications**

This project showcases skills relevant to:

- Network security monitoring  
- Threat detection principles  
- Python automation and scripting  
- Incident reporting workflows  
- Data correlation and analysis techniques
